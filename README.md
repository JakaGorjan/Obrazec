🔐 Login & Registration Form (Slovenian Localization)

This project is a fully designed Login and Registration form, created as a localized Slovenian version of an existing original interface.
The goal of this project was to recreate the look, feel, and user flow of the original page while providing a clean, modern UI, written entirely in Slovenian language (sl-SI).
No backend logic or database connectivity is included—this is a front-end only interface intended for presentation, UI exploration, or integration into a larger system.

The form includes validation, visual feedback, and a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
It uses modern HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript with user-friendly alerts powered by SweetAlert2.
